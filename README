  |  Wordle in the linux terminal  |
======================================

    *Installation:*
Just run 'sudo make install' to install. The makefile takes care of the rest.
To uninstall, run 'sudo make uninstall'. If you want to completely purge it, just rm -rf the directory you cloned this into.

    *Usage*
This program takes no commandline arguments. Just type 'wordle' into your shell once it is installed

    *Credits*
ME!
The dictionary file at /usr/share/dict/words. I ran a few commands on it, since the code uses binary search.

I don't know markdown and can't bother to learn, so enjoy this glorious semi-markdown README
